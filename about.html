        <h2>About</h2>
        This is a site set up to track the Distance in-game leaderboards and provide additional metadata and 
        filtering options.

        This site has been set up by <b>Tiyenti</b> in response to continued debates in regards to how to handle 
        the controversial wheelieboosting technique, as everbody kept complaining about it but nobody actually wanted
        to do anything to try and implement a leaderboard split of some kind for the IL boards. Apparently I have to
        do everything around here.

        This site is based on data collected by <b>Seekr</b>.

        <h2>How data is displayed</h2>
        Data on the leaderboards is taken directly from Seekr's database of times, although we implement some
        filtering. For one thing, cheated times will be removed and will not be displayed on the boards.
        But in addition, irder to help make both sides of the wheelieboosting debate happy, we've implemented a
        filtering system where runs can be tagged as "No WB" and "WB". Players can choose a default tag to assign to
        their runs, but there's also a system in place for map-specific exceptions, and we may choose to tag runs as WB
        if the player does not normally WB but has done so on a specific map. If you want to assign yourself a default ladder,
        you can do so by asking Tiyenti through some place, be that on the official Distance Discord, or otherwise. On the leaderboard 
        pages themselves, you can choose either "Exclude WB", "WB Only", or "All Times"; Exclude WB will assume all unassigned times are 
        No WB times, given that the technique has historically not been that popular, although be sure to keep in mind that this 
        is not a guaruntnee.
